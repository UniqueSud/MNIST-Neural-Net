# MNIST-Neural-Net
This is my first Neural Network that i've designed using tensorflow by watching youtube videos XD.<br><br>
Jupyter Notebook for training Neural Network on MNIST data. :)<br>
The iPynb is in Python3.

# Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that trains a Neural Network on the MNIST Handwritten digits dataset.
It is a fairly simple Notebook made using Google's Tensorflow.

# Dependencies
    TensorFlow CPU Build
   well that is pretty much what is needed :)

# Initialize

## Installing Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu

#### VirtualEnvironment

```sh
$ virtualenv myEnv
$ source myEnv/bin/activate
```
   
### Installing Tensorflow on Ubuntu

```sh
(myEnv)$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow      # for Python 2.7
(myEnv)$ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow     # for Python 3.n
```

#### Updating Pip to latest version

```sh
(myEnv)$ sudo apt-get update
(myEnv)$ pip --version
(myEnv)$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Installing iPythonNotebook and Jupyter

```sh
(myEnv)$ sudo apt-get -y install ipython ipython-notebook
(myEnv)$ pip install jupyter
```

#### Running Jupyter Notebook Server

```sh
(myEnv)$ jupyter notebook
```
and then navigate to the "Neural Net MNIST.ipynb".


Well that is it!
